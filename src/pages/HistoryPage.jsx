          Every other day, my friends would ask me for treats.
          It became a routine, and soon it turned into a fun challenge. But, as we all know, the treats can become expensive!
        </p>
        <p className='text-white text-xl mt-6'>
          So, being a coder, I thought, "Why not build a virtual treat-giving platform where anyone can enjoy their favorite food without spending a dime?"
          That's how the Virtual Treat System was born. Now, you can choose your favorite food, enjoy the game, and be rewarded with your virtual treats every day!
